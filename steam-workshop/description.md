Ever wanted to play on a smaller map than possible in vanilla?
- Then I've got just the treat for you!

[b]Play on six different, smaller galaxy sizes: Diminutive (150 stars), Miniature (100 stars), Minuscule (50 stars), Microscopic (25 stars), Nanoscopic (13 stars), and Infinitesimal (9 stars)![/b]

[h1]Details[/h1]
This mod adds six additional options for the amount of stars that will generate in your galaxy after you start a new game.
[list]
[*][b]Infinitesimal (9 stars):[/b] This is a singleplayer only map, no additional AI players may be selected.
[*][b]Nanoscopic (13 stars):[/b] Up to 1 normal AI player may be selected.
[*][b]Microscopic (25 stars):[/b] Up to 2 AI players may be selected (choose between normal empires and marauder or fallen ones). The map size allows you to choose all of those, but you should not expect it to spawn them, if you do. The option is there so you're better able to customize the two empires you wish to play with. Consider lowering the amount of primitive civilizations or gateways, if some AI players do not spawn.
[*][b]Minuscule (50 stars):[/b] Up to 3 normal AI players, 1 marauder and 2 fallen empires may be selected.
[*][b]Miniature (100 stars):[/b] Up to 4 normal AI players, 1 marauder and 2 fallen empires may be selected.
[*][b]Diminutive (150 stars):[/b] Up to 5 normal AI players, 1 marauder and 2 fallen empires may be selected.
[/list]
Check the screenshots to see how a smaller galaxy looks like in game.
Starting a new game is quick and easy, try experimenting yourself to see how many different shapes are possible! Especially smaller sizes differ significantly from game to game.

[h1]Future Development & Notes[/h1]
I've been asked, if it would be possible to generate systems with more habitable worlds and many more AI empires on the smaller maps (forcing a tall style of play for every single empire).

And while yes, that would certainly be possible, it would also affect other sizes and can't be guaranteed to work every time you start a new game. 
Additionally you wouldn't be able to select which kind of empires will spawn and would be the victim of the RNG every time. 
Thus I have decided against it, as it would also be impossible to turn off, for you as a player, during games where you would not want this.
